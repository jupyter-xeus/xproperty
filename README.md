C++ properties and observer pattern

## Introduction

`xproperty` is a C++ library providing traitlets-style properties.

`xproperty` provides an implementation of the observer patterns relying on C++ template and preprocessor metaprogramming techniques.

Properies of observed objects have no additional memory footprint than the value they hold. The assignment of a new value is simply
replaced at compiled time by

- the call to the validator for that property
- the actual underlying assigment
- the call to the observor for that property.

We also provide the implementation of an `xobserved` class whose static validator and observer are bound to a dynamic unordered map
of callbacks that can be registered dynamically.

Up to version 0.12, `xproperty` requires a C++ compiler supporting C++14. Versions above require a C++ compiler supporting C++17.

## Installation

`xproperty` is a header-only library. We provide a package for the mamba (or conda) package manager.

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge xproperty
```

Or you can directly install it from the sources:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=your_install_prefix
make install
```

## Documentation

To get started with using `xproperty`, check out the full documentation

http://xproperty.readthedocs.io/

## Dependencies

`xproperty` depends on [nlohmann_json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

Versions prior to 0.12.0, also depend on the [xtl](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtl) library.

| `xproperty` |     `xtl`     |
|-------------|---------------|
|   0.11.0    | >=0.7.0,<0.8  |
|   0.10.4    | >=0.6.11,<0.7 |
|   0.10.3    | >=0.6.11,<0.7 |
|   0.10.2    | >=0.6.11,<0.7 |
|   0.10.1    | >=0.6.11,<0.7 |
|   0.10.x    | >=0.6.11,<0.7 |
|   0.9.x     | >=0.6.11,<0.7 |
|   0.8.x     | >=0.5.0,<0.7  |
|   0.7.x     | ^0.4.0        |
|   0.6.x     | ^0.3.5        |

## Usage

- Declaring an observed object `Foo` with two properties named `bar` and `baz` of type `double`.
- Registering a validator, executed prior to assignment, which can potentially coerce the proposed value.
- Registering a notifier, executed after the assignement.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

#include "xproperty/xobserved.hpp"

struct Foo : public xp::xobserved<Foo>
{
    XPROPERTY(double, Foo, bar);
    XPROPERTY(double, Foo, baz);
};
```

Registering an observer and a validator

```cpp
Foo foo;

XOBSERVE(foo, bar, [](Foo& f)
{
    std::cout << "Observer: New value of bar: " << f.bar << std::endl;
});

XVALIDATE(foo, bar, [](Foo&, double& proposal)
{
    std::cout << "Validator: Proposal: " << proposal << std::endl;
    if (proposal < 0)
    {
        throw std::runtime_error("Only non-negative values are valid.");
    }
    return proposal;
});
```

Testing the validated and observed properties

```cpp
foo.bar = 1.0;                           // Assigning a valid value
                                         // The notifier prints "Observer: New value of bar: 1"
std::cout << foo.bar << std::endl;       // Outputs 1.0

try
{
    foo.bar = -1.0;                      // Assigning an invalid value
}
catch (...)
{
    std::cout << foo.bar << std::endl;   // Still outputs 1.0
}
```

Shortcuts to link properties of observed objects

```cpp
// Create two observed objects
Foo source, target;
source.bar = 1.0;

// Link `source.bar` and `target.baz`
XDLINK(source, bar, target, baz);

source.bar = 2.0;
std::cout << target.baz << std::endl;    // Outputs 2.0
```

## Building and Running the Tests

Building the tests requires the [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) testing framework and [cmake](https://cmake.org).

gtest and cmake are available as a packages for most linux distributions. Besides, they can also be installed from conda-forge.

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge gtest cmake
```

Once `gtest` and `cmake` are installed, you can build and run the tests:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ..
make -j2 xtest
```

In the context of continuous integration with Travis CI, tests are run in an environment, which can be activated with

```bash
cd test
mamba env create -f ./test-environment.yml
source activate test-xproperty
cd ..
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON .
make -j2 xtest
```

## Building the HTML Documentation

xpropery's documentation is built with three tools

 - [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org)
 - [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org)
 - [breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io)

While doxygen must be installed separately, you can install breathe by typing

```bash
pip install breathe
```

Breathe can also be installed with `mamba` or `conda`

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge breathe
```

Finally, build the documentation with

```bash
make html
```

from the `docs` subdirectory.
